Smoking Status Prediction Using Bio-Signals

Overview

This project focuses on predicting an individual’s smoking status based on bio-signal data. The dataset comes from the Kaggle Playground Series - Season 3, Episode 24, which provides bio-signal data such as age, height, weight, blood pressure, cholesterol, and glucose levels, to predict whether a person is a smoker or not.

The goal of this project is to build a binary classification model that can accurately predict a person’s smoking status using various machine learning techniques.

Features

	•	Binary Classification Task: Predict whether an individual is a smoker (1) or not (0) based on bio-signal features.
	•	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform detailed analysis of the dataset to uncover key patterns and relationships among the features.
	•	Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, normalize data, and perform feature engineering to prepare the data for model training.
	•	Model Training: Use a range of machine learning algorithms including:
	•	Logistic Regression
	•	Decision Trees
	•	Random Forest Classifiers
	•	Neural Networks
	•	Performance Metrics: Evaluate the models using metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and AUC-ROC curve.

Dataset

The dataset for this project is from the Kaggle Playground Series - Season 3, Episode 24, which includes training and test data files. The main features include:

	•	Age: Age of the person.
	•	Height: Height in centimeters.
	•	Weight: Weight in kilograms.
	•	Blood Pressure: Systolic and diastolic blood pressure readings.
	•	Cholesterol: Cholesterol level.
	•	Glucose: Blood glucose level.
	•	Smoking: The target variable indicating if the individual is a smoker (1) or not (0).

Installation

	1.	Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/smoking-status-prediction.git


	2.	Install the required Python packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt


	3.	Ensure you have access to the dataset on Kaggle:
	•	Download the dataset from the competition: Kaggle - Playground Series S3E24
	•	Place the dataset files (train.csv and test.csv) in the project’s data folder.

Usage

	1.	Open the Jupyter notebook (Smoker_Status_Prediction.ipynb) in the project directory.
	2.	Run the notebook to perform the following:
	•	Data loading and exploration
	•	Feature engineering and preprocessing
	•	Model training and evaluation
	•	Prediction on test data
	3.	Alternatively, you can run the Python script for model training:

python train_model.py


	4.	View the predictions and model evaluation metrics in the output files.

Example

	•	Input: Bio-signal data such as age, height, weight, blood pressure, cholesterol, and glucose levels.
	•	Output: Predicted smoking status for each individual in the test set.

Dependencies

	•	pandas
	•	numpy
	•	scikit-learn
	•	matplotlib
	•	seaborn
	•	tensorflow (if using deep learning models)

Evaluation Metrics

The model performance is evaluated using the following metrics:

	•	Accuracy: Overall correct predictions over the total number of samples.
	•	Confusion Matrix: Breakdown of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.
	•	AUC-ROC: Area under the ROC curve to measure the ability of the model to distinguish between classes.

Future Enhancements

	•	Feature Engineering: Explore advanced feature extraction techniques to further improve prediction accuracy.
	•	Hyperparameter Tuning: Implement automated hyperparameter optimization to fine-tune model performance.
	•	Model Ensembling: Combine multiple models (stacking, bagging, boosting) to improve prediction robustness.
